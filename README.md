# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

### Plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

* Meeting in the mornings to discuss our schedules
* Meeting after class to establish a game plan and decide how we want to work for the day

### Plan for project organization and workflow.

* [Jira on Trello for project management](https://tnoblecmd.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/FGP/board)
* Morning meetings
    * Getting together in the morning to update the project board with our next tasks.
    * Discuss our availability for the day and when we will be online
* Pull requests
    * Communicating when a pull request has been submitted
    * Never merging our own pull requests
    * At least 2 people review the code before merging
    * Communicating by leaving comments on the pull requests

### Different approaches our group discussed for project organization and how we collectively made a decision on which to use.

* Some of the group members have used Trello in the past.
* Joel used an extention of Trello called Jira and recomended it for its organization tools.
* Thus the group decided to utilizing the Jira board and update it daily as we progress though the project.
* For our retro we referred to the recommended list provided by Turing and decided to use 'Easy Retro.' There were a number of different formats but for the sake of fun we selected the starwars theme which includes the categories; light side, dark side, padawans(things to learn), and actions to reach the force. 


### Describe your approach to the code design.

* Grouping methods together by similar function. One person will tackle each group of similar methods. If they need help they will reach out to team members to complete these methods. 
* Potentially breaking things up into smaller classes. We are currently putting all of our code into the stat_tracker file but will reasses if it makes sense to change anyting once we have completed our code and tests. 
* Deciding to progress when our tests are passing and they are within a good percentage rate, with the ability to revisit and refactor later.
 * We will evaluate this more as be work through Iteration 2.
